# Netflix Clone

This project is a simplified front end clone of Netflix. It was created with React and CSS. It uses [The MovieDB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to search for movies and display details.

### Local Development

To run the application you will need a `.env` file with a TMDB api key specified as `API_KEY=KEY_HERE`.

- Install dependencies: run `npm install` in root project
- Create a `.env` file with the API key in this format `API_KEY="api-key"`
- Run project: `npm run dev`
